<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>It's me, Julius! Thanks for visiting my uhm, beautiful website. I'm sorry you saw my HTML practice page. This is just a practice page, so don't take it too seriously. I'm a web developer and I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can go to my <a href="https://www.jccesar.com">website</a> and take a look.
