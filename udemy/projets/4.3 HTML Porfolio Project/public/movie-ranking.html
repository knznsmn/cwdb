    <h1>Best Movies Ever</h1>

    <h2>The Best Movies You Should Watch Before Heaven</h2>

    <h3>The Matrix</h3>
    <p>This is without a doubt hands down the best movie ever. Hackers, AI, computers, and philosophyâ€”the best thoughts all in one movie. What is more to say.</p>

    <h3>Fight Club</h3>
    <p>This is one crazy movie of a lifetime. I was and am still baffled by the reality of insanity, or rather the insanity of reality... Wait, what?</p>

    <h3>Arrival</h3>
    <p>This movie explores the idea of how language shapes our perception of reality, particularly our understanding of time. It has been food for thought for me over the years, making me realize that language encapsulates our perception of reality. And guess what? Just like our sensory perceptions, language is far from perfect. Excuse me while I pick up the pieces of my blown mind.</p>
